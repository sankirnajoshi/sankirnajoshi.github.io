## Getting Started

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

----
## Exploring the Data
Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time import time
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualization code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Census dataset
data = pd.read_csv("census.csv")

# Success - Display the first record
display(data.head(n=1))
```

### Implementation: Data Exploration
A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
- The total number of records, `'n_records'`
- The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
- The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
- The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.

**Hint:** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted. 


```python
# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = len(data)


# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = len(data[data['income'] =='>50K'])

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = len(data[data['income'] =='<=50K'])

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = n_greater_50k/(n_records*1.0)*100

# Print the results
print "Total number of records: {}".format(n_records)
print "Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k)
print "Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k)
print "Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {:.2f}%".format(greater_percent)
```

    Total number of records: 45222
    Individuals making more than $50,000: 11208
    Individuals making at most $50,000: 34014
    Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: 24.78%

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured â€” this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 

Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)
```


![png](finding_donors_files/finding_donors_9_0.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.

Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_raw[skewed] = data[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_raw, transformed = True)
```


![png](finding_donors_files/finding_donors_11_0.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']
features_raw[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_raw[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_raw.head(n = 1))
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>workclass</th>
      <th>education_level</th>
      <th>education-num</th>
      <th>marital-status</th>
      <th>occupation</th>
      <th>relationship</th>
      <th>race</th>
      <th>sex</th>
      <th>capital-gain</th>
      <th>capital-loss</th>
      <th>hours-per-week</th>
      <th>native-country</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0.30137</td>
      <td>State-gov</td>
      <td>Bachelors</td>
      <td>0.8</td>
      <td>Never-married</td>
      <td>Adm-clerical</td>
      <td>Not-in-family</td>
      <td>White</td>
      <td>Male</td>
      <td>0.667492</td>
      <td>0.0</td>
      <td>0.397959</td>
      <td>United-States</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.
 - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
   - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.


```python
# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_raw' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features = pd.get_dummies(features_raw)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.apply(lambda x: 0 if x =='<=50K' else 1)

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features.columns)
print "{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
#print encoded
#print income
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.
    

### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.

Run the code cell below to perform this split.


```python
# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, income, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 

### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
*If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than \$50,000, what would that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset?*  
**Note:** You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.


```python
# TODO: Calculate accuracy
TP = n_greater_50k
FP = n_at_most_50k
TN = 0
FN = 0
accuracy = (TP + TN) / ((TP + TN + FP + FN)*1.0)
precision = TP / ((TP + FP)*1.0)
recall = TP / ((TP + FN)*1.0)
beta = 0.5
# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5
fscore = (1 + beta**2)*(precision*recall)/((beta**2*precision + recall)*1.0)

# Print the results 
print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore)
#print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, Precision: {:.4f}, Recall: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, precision, recall, fscore)
```

    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]
    

###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following supervised learning models are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen
- *Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.* (You may need to do research for this â€” give references!)
- *What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?*
- *What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?*
- *What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?*

**Answer**

Algorithm 1: <b>Support Vector Machines</b>

What are the general applications of each model?
- <u>Answer</u>: Text classification and categorization: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/joachims_98a.pdf

What are its strengths and weaknesses?
- 1.<u>Pros</u>:
Linear SVMs perform very well on binary classification.
They are memory efficient as they only use subset of training data called support vectors. 
They are good when number of features are comparable to number of training points.

- 2.<u>Cons</u>:
A few mislabeled targets can affect the prediction. So we can say that they are very sensitive to noise in the data. Another negative point is that they require a high training time. 

Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?
- SVMs work very well on Binary classification, can handle both linear and non-linear data and performance is good even with less data.

Algorithm 2: <b>Logistic Regression</b>

What are the general applications of each model?
- <u>Answer</u>:Logistic Regression have be used in medical fields eg. detecting Breast cancer in patients http://www.arpapress.com/volumes/vol10issue1/ijrras_10_1_02.pdf

What are its strengths and weaknesses?
- 1.<u>Pros</u>:
LR models are low variance models. They provide output as probabilities.
- 2.<u>Cons</u>:
LR also suffer from high bias as we usually select target function(eg sigmoid) beforehand. Parametric model.

Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?
- Logistic Regression models work well on classification problem like the one specified where output is of the form of 0 and 1. They have low variance and are comparatively robust to outliers in data as can be expected in census data.

Algorithm 3: <b>Adaptive Boosting</b>

What are the general applications of each model?
- <u>Answer</u>: Adaptive Boosting alogrithms have been applied in space exploration to classify and categorize celestial data. One application can be found here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASP..107..279S

What are its strengths and weaknesses?
- 1.<u>Pros</u>:
Built off decision Trees, they too have a very simple structure and high interpretability. AdaBoost provide better results as they combine multiple weak results(decision trees) and provide a boosted output. Handles categorical features very well. Can handle linear as well as non-linear data. Non parametric model.
- 2.<u>Cons</u>:
AdaBoost can suffer from overfitting if too many trees are used.

Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?
- AdaBoost was chosen as it works well on categorical features, is highly interpretable and can provide good classification as its boosting Decision Trees.



### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
 - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
 - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
   - Record the total prediction time.
 - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
 - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!


```python
# TODO: Import two metrics from sklearn - fbeta_score and accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, accuracy_score
def train_predict(learner, sample_size, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
    '''
    inputs:
       - learner: the learning algorithm to be trained and predicted on
       - sample_size: the size of samples (number) to be drawn from training set
       - X_train: features training set
       - y_train: income training set
       - X_test: features testing set
       - y_test: income testing set
    '''
    
    results = {}
    
    # TODO: Fit the learner to the training data using slicing with 'sample_size'
    start = time() # Get start time
    learner = learner.fit(X_train[:sample_size], y_train[:sample_size])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the training time
    results['train_time'] = end - start
        
    # TODO: Get the predictions on the test set,
    #       then get predictions on the first 300 training samples
    start = time() # Get start time
    predictions_test = learner.predict(X_test)
    predictions_train = learner.predict(X_train[0:300])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # TODO: Calculate the total prediction time
    results['pred_time'] = end - start
            
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on the first 300 training samples
    results['acc_train'] = accuracy_score(y_train[0:300],predictions_train)
        
    # TODO: Compute accuracy on test set
    results['acc_test'] = accuracy_score(y_test,predictions_test)
    
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the the first 300 training samples
    results['f_train'] = fbeta_score(y_train[0:300], predictions_train, 0.5)
        
    # TODO: Compute F-score on the test set
    results['f_test'] = fbeta_score(y_test, predictions_test, 0.5)
       
    # Success
    print "{} trained on {} samples.".format(learner.__class__.__name__, sample_size)
        
    # Return the results
    return results
```

### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model â€” you will tune one specific model in a later section.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.

**Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
# TODO: Initialize the three models
clf_A = LinearSVC(random_state=0)
clf_B = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
clf_C = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=0)

# TODO: Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
samples_1 = X_train.shape[0]/100
samples_10 = samples_1*10
samples_100 = X_train.shape[0]

# Collect results on the learners
results = {}
for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:
    clf_name = clf.__class__.__name__
    results[clf_name] = {}
    for i, samples in enumerate([samples_1, samples_10, samples_100]):
        results[clf_name][i] = \
        train_predict(clf, samples, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Run metrics visualization for the three supervised learning models chosen
vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)
```

## Improving Results
In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model
*Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000.*  
**Hint:** Your answer should include discussion of the metrics, prediction/training time, and the algorithm's suitability for the data.

**Answer: **
<p>From the above plots, we can see that <b>AdaBoosting classifier</b> Ensemble Method seems to be most appropriate for the task at hand. This is because it has the best Accuracy and F-score for testing set and seems to be best among all other evaluated models. Although it is slower than SVC and LR, its still very fast and both testing and training times are below 10s.</p>

### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
*In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*

**Answer: ** 
<p>
AdaBoost which means Adaptive Boosting, is a type of an inverted tree, such that the roots are at the top and leaves at the bottom. We start with the entire data at the root and try to divide the data into distinct parts as we go along. When we repeat this multiple times at each step, we get a nice path along the tree branches and can see all the decisions the tree took to get to the conclusion which can be seen at the leaves which in our case is classifying who earns greater that 50K. So, when we train this tree model it comes up with questions based on the data and tries to find optimal answers. However, just the tree ML model will get distracted if there is too much noise; ask weak questions; and end up getting poor answers. To make these weak questions into strong questions that will fetch quality answers, we combine small weak question and make them strong, i.e. we Boost the tree.With AdaBoost, we adjust the weights of incorrect classifications by creating subsets of data and training the model on them. With CharityML data, we are getting an accuracy of over 80% with our predictions and in very less time as well.

### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.

**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!


```python
# TODO: Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
from sklearn import cross_validation
# TODO: Initialize the classifier
clf = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=0)

# TODO: Create the parameters list you wish to tune
parameters = {'n_estimators': [50,75,100],'learning_rate' : [2,1], 'random_state': [0]}

# TODO: Make an fbeta_score scoring object
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=0.5)

#cv = cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit(y_train, 2, random_state = 0)

# TODO: Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid=parameters, scoring=scorer)

# TODO: Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print "Unoptimized model\n------"
print "Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nOptimized Model\n------"
print "Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
```

    Unoptimized model
    ------

    F-score on testing data: 0.7246
    
    Optimized Model
    ------
    Final accuracy score on the testing data: 0.8606
    Final F-score on the testing data: 0.7316
    

### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation
_What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  
**Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

#### Results:

|     Metric     | Benchmark Predictor | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |    0.2478           |     0.8576        |   0.8606        |
| F-score        |    0.2917           |     0.7246        |   0.7316        |


**Answer: **
<p> Accuracy = 0.8609 and F-score = 0.7316 on optimized model. This is slightly better than unoptimized model and shows dramatic improvement over naive predictor. So with better models, the accuracy and f-score are both increasing which is a good sanity check. </p>

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data.  
_Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?_

**Answer:** <p> This is how I would rank the features in ascending order of importance. </p>
- capital-gain: More gain means more income.
- capital-loss: With higher values of this, income should be lower. But if capital-gain is also low, then should not have influence
- occupation: Some occupations have greater income than others
- age: People with more age are generally at a higher position in their occupation and may have higher income.
- education: More educated people will have better opportunities and more income.

### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
 - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
 - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.


```python
# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set 
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
clf.predict(X_test)
# TODO: Extract the feature importances
importances = model.feature_importances_
#print importances
# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```

### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
_How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**? If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?_

**Answer:**
<p> Except marital-status and hours-per-week, remaining features are as discussed in Question 6. My guess is that marital-status suggests that people who were married might have provided the household income. hours-per-week suggests that those who work for a few hours every week, earn income - which is very logical.

### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower â€” at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print "Final Model trained on full data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5))
```

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8606
    F-score on testing data: 0.7316
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8469
    F-score on testing data: 0.7024
    

### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection
*How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?*  
*If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?*

**Answer:**

<p> Both the values of accuracy and f-score went down a little as expected but are still very good. So, if training time is a concern, I would definitely consider using the model with reduced data.
